  HOMEWORK:

  * Start building a catalog of audio actions from your chosen game
       * Create a post with three examples of each sound category. We'll be using these as a reference for as we move through the semester. 
       * Example: https://www.youtube.com/embed/vG6315aMFnA?start=10&end=14
       * Replace the code with the one for your youtube link and change the start and end times to match what you want to show; times are in seconds.
       * I'll create threads for each category and we can see how those sounds are different between the different games.  
          * DX  = Dialogue - any verbal speech in the game.
          * MX = Music - any non-diegetic music.
          * SFX = Sound Effects (Hard Effects) - any sound from an real-life object.
          * FOL = Foley - any sound effect that the player makes.
