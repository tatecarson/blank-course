Computer Space, the world's first commercially sold coin-operated video game and video game system of any kind (predating magnovox odyssey) It's the first coin-operated arcade game to use a video display to generate graphics via video signal (predating Magnovox Odyssey). It was built by Nolan Bushnell (a founder of Atari and Chuck E' Cheese). He wanted video games available to the public but it was too expensive to use computer hardware or it's CPU. So he decided to build his own arcade cabinet (after Galaxy-Game in 1971) entirely of electrical transistors and circuits and discrete logics,( the same parts used to produced and manufacture television. Also the same strategy that Ralph Baer used to make Magnovox Odyssey usd.). To reduce cost and make them more affordable to the public. However, it was not financial success. But Nolan later created and release Pong in 1972, which was very successful.

Considered the most successful game up until that point 

It started out as a game making exercise, to create a table tennis game 

How does the sound tackle immersion?

By 1980, arcade manufacturers included dedicated sound chips known as programmable sound generators, or PSGs (see box 2.1, ‘‘Sound Synthesis’’) into their circuit boards, and more tonal background music and elaborate sound effects developed. Some of the earliest examples of repeating musical loops in games were found in Rally X (Namco/Midway, 1980), which had a six-bar loop (one bar repeated four times, followed by the same melody transposed to a lower pitch),

Namco's 1980 arcade game Rally-X was the first known game to use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to produce sampled tones instead of a tone generator.

First game to use true stereo instead of simulated stereo 

Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use an FM sound chip produced by Yamaha, similar to a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer, which created the music in real time so that it was in synchronization with the game's on-screen action.

The composer Yuzo Koshiro utilized the Genesis hardware effectively to produce "progressive, catchy, techno-style compositions far more advanced than what players were used to"

It sported a specialized custom Sony chip for both the sound generation and for special hardware DSP. It was capable of eight channels of sampled sounds at up to 16-bit resolution, had a wide selection of DSP effects, including a type of ADSR usually seen in high-end synthesizers of the time, and full stereo sound.

OST by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, he also recorded the sound effects

ambient music soundtrack 

About the soundtrack, Reznor said, "it is not music, it's textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive,     scary, frightening kind of thing [...] It's been fun."
