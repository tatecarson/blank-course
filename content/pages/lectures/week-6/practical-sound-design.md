## Guns 

We can't go out to a range and record ourselves, so our next best thing is to piece together something realistic from sound effects libraries. It's our job to take these recordings and to make them sound like what people think guns sound like. More exciting and explosive, instead of pops like firecrackers.

We can break the sound down into the following elements transient, body, thump, tail, foley or mechanical sounds, and bullet/shells. 
  
* transient - slap, kicking sound, and kick drum  
* body
    * Layer gunshots from multiple mic positions  
    * I first had to find recordings in random places. Gunshot sample packs are expensive because of the difficulty of recording them. 
    * I then did an auto trim/split items action to remove the silence. This made it easier to align the gunshots 
    * apply compression and saturation 
* thump - an explosion 
* tail - end of the explosion 
* foley - mechanical sounds 
    * bullet/shells 
* The effect is finished up with some master buss processing
