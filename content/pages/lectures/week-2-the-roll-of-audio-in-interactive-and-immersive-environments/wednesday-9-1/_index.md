# Distance 

How can we determine the distance between the sound source and the listener?

{{% note %}}

* We have for a long time understood that the perception of distance was based primarily on the amount of dry vs. reflected sound that reaches our ears and that therefore reverberation played a very important role in the perception of distance.

* Energy from reverberant signals decays more slowly over distance than dry signals, and the further away from the listener the sound is, the more reverb is heard.

* air absorption 
* temperature, humidity and distance.
* noticeable loss of high frequency content, an overall low pass filtering effect.

# Location

* The perception of the location of a sound in terms of direction in 360 degrees
    * Interaural time difference
    * interaural intensity difference
    * Preceence effect  

{{% note %}}
* Interaural time difference: the time difference it takes for sound to reach both the left and right ears.  
* interaural intensity difference: the difference in intensity, or amplitude, between the left and right ears.
* the precedence effect: When a sound is followed by another sound separated by a sufficiently short time delay, listeners perceive a single auditory event; its perceived spatial location is dominated by the location of the first-arriving sound.


* it is almost impossible to determine the location of a continuous tone, such as a sine wave playing in a room \(Cook ’99\).
Try an expleriment of playing a sine tone and see if we can hear it coming from the speakers

* The process currently used to recreate these cues on headphones is a tech­nology called Head Related Transfer Functions,

* Another somewhat complimentary technology when it comes to spatial audio is ambisonic recording. While not used to actually recreate the main cues of human spatial hearing, it is a great way to compliment these cues by recording a 360­degree image of the space itself. The Unity game engine supports this technology, which their website describes as an ‘audio skybox’

# User Feedback and Game Mechanics

Telling the player what is happening in the game through feedback sounds. 

{{% note %}}

* On a basic level, audio based user feedback is easily understood by anyone who ever had to use a microwave oven, digital camera or any of the myriad consumer electronics goods that surround us in our daily lives.
This is simple sonification. Lets try to think of all the things in our daily lives that include audio feedback. 

ex: 
Car engine - tells pedestrians that a car is around
dinging elevator 
dinging microwave
wake up alarm

* The simplest kind of feedback one can provide through sound is whether an action was completed successfully or not.

What makes a feedback tone portray success or failure of an action?

* The chime almost universally symbolizes successful completion of an action, or positive feedback.

* The buzzer, of course, is noisy, unpleasant to the ear and associated with negative feedback and negative sen­ timents.

* These qualities, being easy to hear in a noisy environment, easy to under­ stand when heard \(also known as legibility\), make them prime examples of the specific demands that user feedback sound design requires.

* Sound can provide much more complex and subtle feedback as well. Add­ ing a low tone to the mix when entering a room can induce an almost sub­ liminal sense of unease in the player;
Great example of this is sinua sacrifice, dialoge in the head adding to a sense of disturbance.

* Contact sounds, the sound the game makes if you hit a target, for instance, are one such great example, but there are far too many for us to list here.

* We all know how much less scary or intense even the most action­packed shots look when watched with the sound off. If you haven’t tried, do so.
Watch some of our example games with the sound off

# Entertain

## Sound Design

{{% note %}}
* While this book does not focus on music composition and production, it would be a mistake to consider sound design and music in isolation from each other.
* Sound design entertains when it is seen as intrinsic to the experience, not added on as an afterthought.

## Music and the Mix

{{% note %}}

* The soundtrack of any game \(or movie\) should be considered as a whole, made up of music, dialog, sound effects and sometimes narration. At any given time, one of these elements should be the predominant one in the mix, based on how the story unfolds. A dynamic mix is a great way to keep the player’s attention and create a truly entertaining experience.
A mix is really important. 

What scenes benefit from music and which would be better with little music and mostly environmental sounds? Think about the purpose of music vs sound effects and how each helps with the story and giving the play valuable information.

* Often, it is the dialog that domi­nates, since it conveys most of the story and narrative.

* How does this scene feel with no music, with other music, or with the real music?

## Defining Immersion

* immersion in VR 
    * non-immersive systems
    * semi-immersive systems
    * fully immersive systems   

{{% note %}}
* Non­immersive systems: typically, simple Augmented Reality systems that affect one sensory input. Playing a 3D game on a laptop is a com­ mon example. This is the type of system most people are familiar with.  Semi­immersive systems: typically allows the users to experience a 3D world while remaining connected to the real world. A flight simulator game played on a multiscreen system with realistic hardware, such as a flight yoke, would be a good example of such a system.  Fully immersive systems: affect all or most sensory inputs and attempt to completely cut off the user from their surroundings through the use of head mounted displays, headphones, and additional systems such as gaming treadmills, which allow the user to walk or even run though a virtual environment.

* So when we talk about immersion for games, its really not close to what you get with VR, but we can try.

## Immersion in psychology 

Werner Wirth: 
1. Players begin to create a representation in their minds of the space or world the game is offering.
2. Players begin to think of the media space or game world as their main reference (aka primary ego reference).
3. Players are able to obtain useful information from the environment.

## Immersive characteristics in games

1. characteristics that create a rich mental model of the game environment
2. Characteristics that create consistency amongst the various elements of the environment

## Sensory rich environments

* Multiple channels of sensory information.  
* Exhaustiveness of sensory information.  
* Cognitively challenging environments.  
* Possessing a strong narrative element.

## Breaking immersion

* Lack of incongruous audio/visual cues.  
* Consistent behavior from objects in the game world.  
* continuous presentation of the game world - commercials or level reset
* The ability to interact with objects in the game world.
