## **Course Delivery and Instructional Methods:**

This is a studio course.  Topics are explored in this course through short lectures, class discussion, instructor guided activities, individual student projects, and collaborative work.  


## **Classroom Policies:**

### **Attendance and Make-up Policy:**

Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes. After **three** absences, 10 points will be deducted from the attendance grade for each additional absence. 

Late work will only be accepted with a documented excuse. Students may redo work they received an undesirable grade on once, but only if they turned in something by the original due date. The deadline for redoing work is a week after the original due date. After this time, no late work will be accepted.  


### **Accessibility Statement:**

Dakota State University strives to ensure that physical resources, as well as information and communication technologies, are reasonably accessible to users in order to provide equal access to all. If you encounter any accessibility issues, you are encouraged to immediately contact the instructor of the course and Dakota State University's ADA Office, which will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

DSU's ADA Office is located in the Learning Engagement Center and can be contacted by calling 605-256-5121 or emailing [dsu-ada@dsu.edu](mailto:dsu-ada@dsu.edu). Students seeking ADA accommodations (such as non-standard note taking or extended time and/or a quiet space taking exams and quizzes) can log into the DSU portal to access [https://portal.sdbor.edu/dsu-student/student-resources/disability-services/Pages/default.aspx/](https://portal.sdbor.edu/dsu-student/student-resources/disability-services/Pages/default.aspx/) for additional information and the link to the Disability Services Request Form. You will need to provide documentation of your disability and the ADA Coordinator must confirm the need before officially authorizing accommodations.


### **Academic Honesty Statement:**

Cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty run contrary to the purpose of higher education and will not be tolerated in this course. Please be advised that, when the instructor suspects plagiarism, the Internet and other standard means of plagiarism detection will be used to resolve the instructor’s concerns. The South Dakota Board of Regents Student Academic Misconduct Policy can be found here: [SDBOR Policy 2.33](https://www.sdbor.edu/policy/Documents/2-33.pdf).

## **Communication and Feedback:**


### **Preferred Email Contact Method:**

[Tate.carson@dsu.edu](mailto:Tate.carson@dsu.edu)	


### **Email Response Time:**

Within 48 hours when class is in session


### **Feedback on Assignments:**

Within one week of the assignment due date


### **Names and Pronouns:**

At DSU everyone has the right to be addressed by the name and personal pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, including non-binary pronouns, for example, they/them/theirs, ze/zir/zirs, etc. Students can request a name change using the **Change Name/Preferred Name or Address** form at [https://support.dsu.edu/](https://support.dsu.edu/). This will change the display name in D2L and across other campus systems. Students can always email me to let me know what pronouns they use. 

To create and maintain an inclusive learning environment, it is important that we respect the names and pronouns of our peers in this class. I expect everyone to be serious and respectful when classmates share their names and pronouns. Mistakes in addressing one another may happen. If you hear someone make a mistake, please correct them and move on. ("I think Sam uses they, not she.") If you make a mistake or are corrected, please say "thank you" and move on. ("Thank you. They made a great point about the film.") To learn more about pronouns and why they are important please visit [https://www.mypronouns.org/](https://www.mypronouns.org/) 

## **Student Learning Outcomes:**

By the end of this course, students will be able to: 



* describe the history of spatial audio and game audio
* identify and describe the various aspects of spatial audio psychoacoustics, or how sound influences our perception of space 
* apply their knowledge of spatial audio psychoacoustics to creating an immersive audio environment in a game 
* demonstrate a basic understanding of procedural sound synthesis, audio programming, and implementation using the Unity game engine
    * This is to prepare students for DAD 424, where they will work with students from Computer Game Design to create a complete game. 


## **Evaluation Procedures:**

### **Assessments:**

Attendance/Participation = 30% of earned grade 

Participation will be assessed through written responses to assigned readings, videos or podcasts. The responses will be collected through D2L or Perusall. 

 Mini-projects = 50% of earned grade.

Final project and proposal = 20% of earned grade 



### **Final Examination:**

TBA


### **Performance Standards and Grading Policy:**

90% and above = A

80%-89% = B

70%-79% = C

60% - 69% = D

59% or below = F


### **Student Verification Statement and Proctoring Policy:**

Federal law requires that universities verify the identity of students when course materials and/or course assessment activities are conducted either partially or entirely online. A student’s Desire2Learn (D2L) login and password are intended to provide the student with secure access to course materials and are also intended to help the university meet this federal mandate. Some DSU Faculty also require the use of a proctor for exams in distance-delivered (Internet) courses and this requirement provides a second level of student identity verification. Students are responsible for any proctoring fees, if applicable. Finally, an instructor who uses web conferencing technology may require students to use a webcam during exams, as another means of student identity verification through voice and visual recognition.




## **Freedom in Learning Statement:**

Students are responsible for learning the content of any course of study in which they are enrolled. Under Board of Regents and University policy, student academic performance shall be evaluated solely on an academic basis and students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any course of study.  It has always been the policy of Dakota State University to allow students to appeal the decisions of faculty, administrative, and staff members and the decisions of institutional committees.  Students who believe that an academic evaluation is unrelated to academic standards but is related instead to judgment of their personal opinion or conduct should contact the dean of the college which offers the class to initiate a review of the evaluation.


## **COVID-19 Policies:**

During this pandemic, students must abide by all DSU policies and public health rules put forward by the state of South Dakota, the Board of Regents, and Dakota State University to promote the health and well-being of fellow students and your own personal self-care. 

As with other disruptive behaviors, we have the right to dismiss you from the classroom (Zoom and physical), or other class activities if you fail to abide by these COVID-19 policies. You will also be alerted to any possible course format changes in response to DSU decisions about COVID-19 during the semester.
