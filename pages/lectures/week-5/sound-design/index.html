MacDonald was also a voice actor, most notably the voice of Mickey Mouse. Since recording equipment was expensive, very bulky and therefore could not be moved out of the studio to record a sound, Mac Donald and his colleagues invented a multitude of devices and contraptions to create his sound world. These contraptions were then performed to picture in real time by the sound artist, which required both practice and expertise.</p></section><section><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1iRsCoP4Nw title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><aside class=notes><p>Disney’s approach was contrasted by the Warner Brothers team on their “Looney Tunes” and “Merry Melodies” cartoons, as early as 1936. Sound designer Tregoweth Brown and composer Carl Stalling worked together to create a unique sound world that blended musical cues to highlight the action on the screen, such as timpani hits for collisions or pizzicato strings for tip toeing, together with recorded sounds extracted from the growing Warner Brother audio library. In that regard, Brown’s work isn’t dissimilar the work of music concrete pioneers such as Pierre Schaeffer in Paris, who was using pre­recorded sounds to create soundscapes, and Brown was truly a pioneer of sound design. Brown’s genius was to re­contextualize sounds, such as the sound of a car’s tire skidding played against a character making an abrupt stop. His work opened the door to luminaries such as Ben Burtt, the man behind the sound universe of Star Wars.</p></section><section><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBKKXjNf1sE title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><aside class=notes><p>Ben Burtt’s work is perhaps the most influential of any sound designer to date. While the vast majority of his work was done for movies, most notably for the Star Wars film franchise, a lot of his sounds are also found in video games and have influenced almost every sound designer since. Burtt’s genius comes from his ability to blend sounds together, often from relatively com­ mon sources, in such a way that when played together to the visual they form a new quantity that somehow seamlessly appears to complement and enhance the visuals. Whether it is the sound of a light saber or a Tie fighter, Burtt’s work has become part of our culture at large and far transcends sound design</p></section><section><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FcwQPZYXCGM title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><aside class=notes><p>A discussion of sound design pioneers would be incomplete without men­ tioning Doug Grindstaff, whose work on the original TV show Star Trek between 1966 and 1969 has also become iconic but perhaps slightly over­ looked. Grindstaff’s work defined our expectations of what sliding doors, teleportation devices, phasors and many other futuristic objects ought to sound like. Grindstaff was also a master of re­purposing sounds. The ship’s engine sound was created with an air conditioner, and he made sure that each place in the ship had its own sound. The engineering section had a differ­ ent tonality than the flight deck, which was something relatively new at the time. It allowed the viewer to associate a particular place with a tone, and an avid viewer of the show could tell where the action was taking place without needing to look at the picture. In that regard, Grindstaff ’s work was visionary and helped further expectations on the role of sound design in visual media.</p></section><section><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dcAyX3l7UtE title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></section><section><h2 id=effective-sound-design>Effective sound design</h2><ul><li>exciting, often bigger than life</li><li>congruent with the visuals</li><li>clearly legible</li><li>stylistically appropriate</li><li>provides information to the user</li><li>complete silence should be avoided</li><li>break up complex sounds into separate layers</li><li>avoid repeating samples</li></ul><aside class=notes><ol><li>Effective sound design is exciting, often bigger than life.</li><li>Effective sound design is congruent with the visuals. A great sound is useless if when put to visuals it doesn’t complement them well. Some sounds on the other hand will only come to life when played against
the right visuals.</li><li>Effective sound design is always clearly legible, that is, its purpose
or meaning in the game, scene or overall context should be clearly understood and unambiguous. Ambiguity arises when a sound could be attributed to more than one object in the scene or when the gamer or viewer is confused as to why the sound was played at all.</li><li>stylistically appropriate .While a given sound may be extremely effective in the context of a medieval game, it may not work at all in the context of a science fiction piece. Another way to look at this is that a sound that may be extremely effective in the con­ text of a retro 8bit game, would probably appear completely wrong, possibly comical, in a modern first­person shooter game. We must adhere to the conventions of the medium and genre, unless there’s a very good reason to break these.</li><li>Effective sound design provides information to the user. This can mean information about the object itself, such as its weight and tex­ ture, as well as the purpose of the object in the context of the game. Is it a positive development? Does this object or character constitute a threat to me?</li><li>Complete silence should be avoided. Inexperienced sound designers may sometimes try to use silence as a dramatic device by turning off all sound effects and music in a scene. However, by inserting silence into a scene, the attention of the viewer/player will be diverted to the sounds in their immediate environment, turning their attention away from the game, and the desired impact is not achieved. From the sound of an air conditioner unit in the background to a car passing by, their attention might start to turn to their surroundings, effectively breaking immersion.</li><li>Always break complex sounds up into separate layers, each layer serv­ ing its own purpose. A gun for instance may be broken down into a very sharp snappy transient, a detonation sound and a sub layer, altogether creating a rich full spectrum and impactful sound. Breaking sounds into layers is especially useful in game audio where variations of the same sounds are often required to break up monotony. This allows the sound designer to create multiple variations by swapping one or two layers at a time, therefore creating endless variations with­ out sacrificing continuity and consistency.</li></ol></section><section><h2 id=sound-design-guidelines>Sound design guidelines</h2><ul><li>the size of an object often can be conveyed by its pitch</li><li>the mass or weight of a sound is related to the amount of low end in the sound</li><li>transients are important for sharp detonation, impacts and percussive sounds</li><li>the law of two and a half</li></ul><aside class=notes><ul><li>The Size of an Object Can Often Be Related to the Pitch of the Sound<ul><li>The same sample played at different pitches will imply different sizes for the object that creates the sound.
