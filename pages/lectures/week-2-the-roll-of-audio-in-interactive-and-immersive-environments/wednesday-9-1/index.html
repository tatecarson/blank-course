Try an expleriment of playing a sine tone and see if we can hear it coming from the speakers</p></li><li><p>The process currently used to recreate these cues on headphones is a tech­nology called Head Related Transfer Functions,</p></li><li><p>Another somewhat complimentary technology when it comes to spatial audio is ambisonic recording. While not used to actually recreate the main cues of human spatial hearing, it is a great way to compliment these cues by recording a 360­degree image of the space itself. The Unity game engine supports this technology, which their website describes as an ‘audio skybox’</p></li></ul></aside></section><section><h1 id=user-feedback-and-game-mechanics>User Feedback and Game Mechanics</h1><p>Telling the player what is happening in the game through feedback sounds.</p><aside class=notes><ul><li>On a basic level, audio based user feedback is easily understood by anyone who ever had to use a microwave oven, digital camera or any of the myriad consumer electronics goods that surround us in our daily lives.
This is simple sonification. Lets try to think of all the things in our daily lives that include audio feedback.</li></ul><p>ex:
Car engine - tells pedestrians that a car is around
dinging elevator
dinging microwave
wake up alarm</p><ul><li>The simplest kind of feedback one can provide through sound is whether an action was completed successfully or not.</li></ul><p>What makes a feedback tone portray success or failure of an action?</p><ul><li><p>The chime almost universally symbolizes successful completion of an action, or positive feedback.</p></li><li><p>The buzzer, of course, is noisy, unpleasant to the ear and associated with negative feedback and negative sen­ timents.</p></li><li><p>These qualities, being easy to hear in a noisy environment, easy to under­ stand when heard (also known as legibility), make them prime examples of the specific demands that user feedback sound design requires.</p></li><li><p>Sound can provide much more complex and subtle feedback as well. Add­ ing a low tone to the mix when entering a room can induce an almost sub­ liminal sense of unease in the player;
Great example of this is sinua sacrifice, dialoge in the head adding to a sense of disturbance.</p></li><li><p>Contact sounds, the sound the game makes if you hit a target, for instance, are one such great example, but there are far too many for us to list here.</p></li><li><p>We all know how much less scary or intense even the most action­packed shots look when watched with the sound off. If you haven’t tried, do so.
Watch some of our example games with the sound off</p></li></ul></aside></section><section><h1 id=entertain>Entertain</h1><h2 id=sound-design>Sound Design</h2><aside class=notes><ul><li>While this book does not focus on music composition and production, it would be a mistake to consider sound design and music in isolation from each other.</li><li>Sound design entertains when it is seen as intrinsic to the experience, not added on as an afterthought.</li></ul></aside></section><section><h2 id=music-and-the-mix>Music and the Mix</h2><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjLip2FZLuA title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><aside class=notes><ul><li>The soundtrack of any game (or movie) should be considered as a whole, made up of music, dialog, sound effects and sometimes narration. At any given time, one of these elements should be the predominant one in the mix, based on how the story unfolds. A dynamic mix is a great way to keep the player’s attention and create a truly entertaining experience.
A mix is really important.</li></ul><p>What scenes benefit from music and which would be better with little music and mostly environmental sounds?

A flight simulator game played on a multiscreen system with realistic hardware, such as a flight yoke, would be a good example of such a system.  Fully immersive systems: affect all or most sensory inputs and attempt to completely cut off the user from their surroundings through the use of head mounted displays, headphones, and additional systems such as gaming treadmills, which allow the user to walk or even run though a virtual environment.</p></li><li><p>So when we talk about immersion for games, its really not close to what you get with VR, but we can try.</p></li></ul></aside></section><section><h2 id=immersion-in-psychology>Immersion in psychology</h2><p>Werner Wirth:</p><ol><li>Players begin to create a representation in their minds of the space or world the game is offering.</li><li>Players begin to think of the media space or game world as their main reference (aka primary ego reference).</li><li>Players are able to obtain useful information from the environment.</li></ol></section><section><h2 id=immersive-characteristics-in-games>Immersive characteristics in games</h2><ol><li>characteristics that create a rich mental model of the game environment</li><li>Characteristics that create consistency amongst the various elements of the environment</li></ol><aside class=notes><p>How do we create a mental model through sound?</p><p>What kinds of sounds or effects might be the most difficult to consistency between?</p></aside></section><section><h2 id=sensory-rich-environments>Sensory rich environments</h2><ul><li>Multiple channels of sensory information. </li><li>Exhaustiveness of sensory information. </li><li>Cognitively challenging environments. </li><li>Possessing a strong narrative element.</li></ul></section><section><h2 id=breaking-immersion>Breaking immersion</h2><ul><li>Lack of incongruous audio/visual cues. </li><li>Consistent behavior from objects in the game world. </li><li>continuous presentation of the game world - commercials or level reset</li><li>The ability to interact with objects in the game world.</li></ul></section><section><ul><li><p>Start with a new scene</p></li><li><p>Explore the main windows</p><ul><li>Hierarchy window</li><li>scene view</li><li>inspector</li><li>project</li><li>game view</li><li>play mode</li></ul></li><li><p>navigate using toolbar</p><ul><li>Pan: Select the Hand tool in the Toolbar, and click and drag in the Scene view to move your view.</li><li>Zoom: Holding Alt (Windows) or Option (macOS), right-click and drag in the Scene view to zoom.</li><li>Orbit: Holding Alt (Windows) or Option (macOS), left-click and drag to orbit around the current pivot point.
